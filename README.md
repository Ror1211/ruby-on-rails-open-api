# Stripe's OpenAPI Specification

This repository contains an [OpenAPI specification][openapi] for Stripe's API.
Both JSON and YAML formats are included and available in the `openapi` directory.

## Vendor Extensions

The specification ships with a few vendor-specific fields to help represent
information in ways that are difficult in OpenAPI by default.

### `x-expandableFields`

Resources include an `x-expandableFields` that contains a list of fields that
are expandable by making an API request with an `expand` parameter. See
[expanding objects][expand].

For example:

``` yaml
definitions:
  ...
  charge:
    ...
    x-expandableFields:
    - balance_transaction
```

### `x-expansionResources`

Any expandable field within a resource contains a set of references to the
resources that it might be expanded to.

For example:

``` yaml
definitions:
  ...
  charge:
    properties:
      ...
      balance_transaction:
        description: ID of the balance transaction that describes the impact of this
          charge on your account balance (not including refunds or disputes).
        type:
        - string
        x-expansionResources:
          oneOf:
          - "$ref": "#/definitions/balance_transaction"
```

### `x-polymorphicResources`

Some API responses are "polymorphic" in that they might return multiple types
of resources which is a case that OpenAPI can't handle. In these cases the spec
will reference a "synthetic" resource which is an aggregate of the properties
common to all the possible resources. It will also include the field
`x-polymorphicResources` which references those resources more precisely.

For example:

``` yaml
definitions:
  ...
  external_account_source:
    properties:
      ...
    x-polymorphicResources:
      oneOf:
      - "$ref": "#/definitions/bank_account"
      - "$ref": "#/definitions/card"
```

### `x-resourceId` and Fixtures

Resources include `x-resourceId` which is a canonical name for each resource.
It can be used in conjunction with the files `openapi/fixtures.{json,yaml}` to
look up a sample representation (otherwise known as a "fixture") of the
resource.

For example:

``` yaml
# spec.yaml
---
definitions:
  ...
  charge:
    ...
    x-resourceId: charge

# fixtures.yaml
---
invoice_line_item:
  ...
```
